üì° Communication module 
-----------------------
The communication module is used interface with the IDLab server that stores the mobileDNA data. With its function, one can fetch the mobileDNA appevents/sessions/notifications/connectivity data. 

If you want fetch the latest data, you should generate and restore a snapshot of the server first. 

**Warning** Don't touch this module if you don't have access to the ES server! You need the `config.py` file with the credentials. You will get them if you are authorized üòâ.

Find more information about how the functions in the `docs <docs/communication/communication.md>`_.

‚è∫Ô∏è Core module
---------------
The core module contains the main functionality of the package. It is used to load and preprocess the appevents,
sessions and notifications data

Find more information in the `docs <docs/core/>`_.

‚ö°Ô∏è Advanced module
-------------------
This module contains advanced functionality that is not used in the standard workflow. It has some machine learning/
data mining functions that can be used to extract more information from the data. To be improved and expanded.
(e.g. for guessing people's home locations, estimating people's battery health, ...).

üìä Dashboard module 
-------------------
The dashboard module is used to visualize the mobileDNA data. To be developed.

Ô∏èüíæ Cache module
------------------
This module contains a *app_meta.npy* file that contains extra information about the applications (fancyname, category, custom categorisation,
...). The cache is used to speed up the loading of the data.
